The provided updateSourceCode.js script primarily focuses on updating the submodules to track the main branch, committing these changes in the submodules, and then updating the main monorepo to reflect these changes. Here's a breakdown of what each step does:

Checkout main branch and pull latest changes for each submodule:
This updates each submodule to the latest commit on its main branch.

Update submodules configuration to track the main branch:
This modifies the .gitmodules file to ensure that each submodule is set to track the main branch.

Update submodules to the latest commit on the main branch:
This fetches the latest commits from the main branch of each submodule and merges them.

Add and commit the changes in the main repository:
This stage adds and commits the updates to the .gitmodules file and any changes in the submodule references to the main repository.

Finally, it pushes these changes to the main repository.

updateSubmodules();
This script performs the following actions:

- Ensures that each submodule is checked out to its main branch and pulls the latest changes.
- Configures each submodule to track the main branch.
- Updates each submodule to the latest commit on the main branch.
- Commits the updated .gitmodules file and any submodule reference changes in the main repository.
- Pushes these changes to the remote repository of the main monorepo.

This ensures that both the submodules and the main monorepo are updated to their respective latest states.

Understanding the Steps in the Script
Checkout main branch and pull latest changes for each submodule:

Checkout: This means switching to the main branch of each submodule. If you were working on a different branch or had uncommitted changes, this command ensures you are on the main branch and it's up-to-date.

Pull latest changes: This fetches the latest changes from the remote repository for the main branch and integrates them into your local main branch.
In simpler terms: Imagine you have several projects (submodules) within a larger project (main monorepo). This step ensures each smaller project is up-to-date with the latest version from the central place where you store it (the remote repository).

Update submodules configuration to track the main branch:

Track the main branch: This configures the submodules to always follow changes from the main branch. Normally, submodules might be set to follow a specific commit. By tracking the main branch, we ensure they always point to the latest code on the main branch.
In simpler terms: You set each smaller project (submodule) to always look at the latest version of its main line of development.
Update submodules to the latest commit on the main branch:

Update to latest commit: This fetches the latest changes from the main branch of each submodule and updates your local copy to match.
In simpler terms: You pull in the latest changes for each smaller project to ensure you have the most current version of everything.
Add and commit the changes in the main repository:

Add and commit changes: This step stages and commits any changes to the submodule references in the main repository. It also updates the .gitmodules file to ensure it reflects the current state of tracking the main branch.
Push changes: Finally, it pushes these committed changes to the remote repository of the main monorepo.
In simpler terms: After updating all smaller projects, you tell the larger project (main monorepo) to recognize these updates and push these acknowledgments to the central place where you store the larger project.

Detailed Breakdown
Checkout main branch and pull latest changes for each submodule:

sh
Copy code
git submodule foreach 'git checkout main; git pull origin main'
Checkout: Switches to the main branch of each submodule.
Pull: Updates the local branch with the latest changes from the remote main branch.
In practice: Ensures all submodules are on their main branches and up-to-date with their remote counterparts.
Update submodules configuration to track the main branch:

sh
Copy code
git submodule foreach 'git config -f $toplevel/.gitmodules submodule.$name.branch main'
Update configuration: Changes the .gitmodules file to ensure each submodule is set to follow the main branch.
In practice: This ensures that future updates will automatically follow the main branch of each submodule.
Update submodules to the latest commit on the main branch:

sh
Copy code
git submodule update --remote --merge
Update to latest commit: Fetches the latest changes from the main branch of each submodule and merges them.
In practice: This ensures that your local copy of each submodule is up-to-date with the latest changes from its main branch.
Add and commit the changes in the main repository:

sh
Copy code
git add .gitmodules
git add -u
git commit -m 'Update submodules to track the main branch'
git push origin main
Add changes: Stages changes to the .gitmodules file and any changes to submodule references.
Commit: Commits these changes in the main repository.
Push: Pushes these commits to the remote repository of the main monorepo.
In practice: This step records and shares the updates to submodules within the main repository, ensuring everything is in sync.
Overall Flow
Ensure submodules are up-to-date: Each submodule is switched to its main branch and updated to the latest version from the remote repository.
Configure submodules to follow the main branch: Ensures that submodules will continue to track the main branch for future updates.
Update the main repository: The main repository recognizes the updates to submodules and commits these changes, pushing them to the remote repository.
This script automates the process of keeping all parts of a monorepo and its submodules synchronized with their latest versions, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of conflicts or outdated dependencies.
