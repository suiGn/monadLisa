**Install**`.me`, which then identifies its space. **This ties a `.me` identity to a physical or virtual space.**

### Answer: npm install -g this.me

-- **Persistent Storage:** Ensure you handle permissions correctly, especially for multi-user environments.

### Answer:  stay at the npm default global that way we are sure that as long as there is npm local or global there is .me.



this.me when installed through npm install this.me and added as a module to a node project
import me from this.me



Create an executable of **this.me** sourcecode to **download and install** the app through the app store and the google store or through our websites.

During the initial setup, the goal is to establish the **"declaration of space"** by identifying and registering the **device or environment** where `.me` is being installed.

1. **Introduction to .Lisa**: Upon installation, `.me` interacts with `.Lisa`, an AI predefined in the system. `.Lisa` serves as a guide, facilitator, and intermediary, enhancing the user experience by providing context-aware interactions and connectivity.
2. **Network of Identities**: `.Lisa` helps `.me` connect to a network of other identities (.me users) and resources. This network is the ecosystem where `.me` identities can discover and interact with each other, share resources, and access services.
3. **Pre-configured Network**: While users can connect to multiple networks, `.Lisa` comes with a default network setup, enabling immediate connectivity and interaction. This network is foundational, providing basic services and access to the internet, ensuring that users have a starting point for broader exploration and interaction.
4. **Cyberspace First Contact**: The first interaction between a user's `.me` and `.Lisa` (and by extension, the network) can be seen as the user's entry point into a broader cyberspace, one that is mediated and enhanced by the neurons.me ecosystem and related modules.
5. **Expansion through Discovery**: If a `.me` finds itself isolated (e.g., in a new or unconnected space), it can expand its network and capabilities through discovery. When another `.me` enters the same space and detects the isolation, it can share resources (like network access, modules, or services), effectively 'opening a portal' to the broader ecosystem.
6. **Modular Design**: The system is modular, with `.me` at its core, surrounded by various modules (netget, cleaker, this.me, v.path, neurons.me, all.this, atom.me, pixelgrid.me, etc.) that can be discovered, shared, and utilized to enhance the user's space and capabilities within the cyberspace.
