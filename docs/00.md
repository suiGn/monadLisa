# Mono Repo Setup_
Each submodule in Git is its own repository with its own history, managed separately from the parent repository.
Changes made in the submodule need to be committed in the submodule first, then the parent repository needs to update its reference to the new commit in the submodule.

Version Control: When you commit in the parent monorepo, it tracks the specific commit of the submodule. This allows you to control exactly which version of the submodule is used, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across environments.
