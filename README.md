The Monad of which we shall here speak, is nothing but a simple substance, which enters into compounds. By 'simple' it means 'without pars'. (Theod. 10)

# Deployment and Management of MonadLisa with PM2
This guide would detail steps for installing PM2 (if not already installed), running your monadLisa with PM2, and setting it up to restart automatically on server reboot.

1. Install PM2 globally if it's not already installed:
   ```bash
   npm install pm2 -g
   ```

2. Navigate to your MonadLisa application directory and start it with PM2:
   ```bash
   pm2 start index.js --name "monadLisa"
   ```

3. Ensure PM2 and your application auto-start at server reboot:
   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

4. Provide commands for monitoring and logs:
   ```bash
   pm2 status
   pm2 logs monadLisa
   ```

### Introducing MonadLisa: The Keystone of neurons.me Technology

**MonadLisa**: MonadLisa stands as the quintessential embodiment of the [neurons.me](https://neurons.me) technology, serving as the central platform where the diverse modules and utilities of the neurons.me ecosystem converge. It is not just a product but a demonstration of the modularity and integration capabilities inherent in the neurons.me framework.

**Official Representation**: As the front face of our technology, MonadLisa is not only a testament to our modulation but also a central hub for users to experience the full potential of neurons.me technology. Its official website, [monadlisa.com](https://monadlisa.com/), serves as the gateway for users to explore, understand, and interact with the capabilities of neurons.me modules in a holistic environment.

**Modularity and Independence**: Each module within the neurons.me ecosystem is designed to function independently yet possesses the inherent capability to integrate with other modules, forming more complex systems. MonadLisa leverages this principle, demonstrating the power of modular design and the synergistic potential of these modules when combined.

**Conclusion**: MonadLisa  is a manifestation of the modular design philosophy that underpins the **neurons.me ecosystem.** It serves as a living example of how individual utilities and modules can be woven together to create an integrated and functional whole, showcasing the flexibility and adaptability of neurons.me technology.
