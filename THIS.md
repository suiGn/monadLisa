# THIS.IMG
---------
Designed to **standardize image data,** transforming it into a **structured format** that is readily accessible and interpretable by machine learning models.

**Machine learning** models often **use specific image** sizes and styles depending on the model architecture and the task at hand. **this.img** comes with some common **presets**  used in machine learning, allowing for **easy configuration** depending on your needs. 

### Below is the list of available presets:

- `default64`: Standard 64x64 resolution, 3 channels (rgb) color, **'jpeg'.**
- `small32`: Small **32x32** resolution, 3 channels (rgb) color, **'jpeg'.**
- `large128`: Large **128x128** resolution, 3 channels (rgb) color, **'jpeg'.**
- `highResColor256`: High-resolution **256x256**, 3 channels (rgb) color, **'jpeg'.**
- `grayscale32`: Small **32x32** resolution, grayscale 1 color channel, **'jpeg'.**
- `grayscale64`: Standard **64x64** resolution, grayscale 1 color channel, **'jpeg'.**
- `highResGray256`: High-resolution **256x256**, 1 color channel. grayscale, **'jpeg'.**

You can use these presets directly by referencing their names when calling the `thisImg` function.

## Example Usage in Code:
```javascript
// Example of processing an image using a preset
const imagePath = 'path/to/image.jpg';
// Use a high-resolution grayscale preset
thisImg(imagePath, PRESETS.highResGray256)
  .then(result => {
    console.log('Processed Image:', result);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error processing image:', error);
  });
```

### Common Image Sizes for Machine Learning
1. **Small Size**: Commonly used for basic models and when computational resources are limited.
   - **Size**: 32x32
   - Often used in datasets like CIFAR-10.
2. **Medium Size**: A balance between detail and computational efficiency.
   - **Size**: 64x64 or 128x128
   - Typical for intermediate complexity models.
3. **Large Size**: Used for models requiring high detail.
   - **Size**: 256x256 or 299x299
   - Used in more complex models, such as those for high-resolution image classification.

### Handling Color Channels
- **RGB (Color)**: 3 channels (standard for colored images)
- **Grayscale**: 1 channel (used for reducing computational load or when color is not informative)

## this.img.browser.js
Returns an HTMLImageElement that can be used on a canvas.
 This function supports loading from both URLs and Blob objects.

## Core Concepts and Functionality
**Standardization of Image Content:** this.img standardizes various aspects of image data, including dimensions, color schemes, and encoding formats, ensuring uniformity and compatibility with ML models.

**Data-Driven Image Analysis:** The module supports data-driven approaches to image analysis, preparing image content not just for display but for in-depth computational examination and interpretation.

The ultimate goal of this.img is to ensure that every processed image is structured in a way that makes it immediately usable for machine learning purposes, enhancing the data's value and applicability in intelligent systems.
