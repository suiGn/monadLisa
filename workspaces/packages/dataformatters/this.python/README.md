### [Project Status : Experimental and Under Development, Subject to Major Changes]
The module is in active development, and as such, it is subject to significant changes as we refine our approach and methodologies to best support our goals.

# this.pixel for General Pixel-Level Abstraction:
Clarifying this.pixel to focus on pixel-level data abstraction allows it to serve a unique purpose **distinct from this.img and this.video**, which deal with more specific file formats or higher-level constructs. **this.pixel** will act as a module for any scenario where individual pixel manipulation or analysis is required, irrespective of the source being an image, a video, or even live screen data.

This distinction can be particularly useful in fields like computer graphics, visualization, or areas where the **raw pixel data needs to be accessed** or modified directly for various effects, analyses, or transformations. It opens up possibilities for creative and technical applications, from artistic pixel manipulation to detailed scientific visualizations.

## Installation
```bash
npm install this.pixel
```

## Modular Data Structures:
**[this.me](https://suign.github.io/this.me)  - [this.audio](https://suign.github.io/this.audio) - [this.text](https://suign.github.io/this.text) - [this.wallet](https://suign.github.io/this.wallet) - [this.img](https://suign.github.io/this.img) - [this.pixel](https://suign.github.io/Pixels) - [be.this](https://suign.github.io/be.this) - [this.DOM](https://suign.github.io/this.DOM) - [this.env](https://suign.github.io/this.env/) - [this.GUI](https://suign.github.io/this.GUI) - [this.be](https://suign.github.io/this.be) - [this.video](https://suign.github.io/this.video) - [this.atom](https://suign.github.io/this.atom) - [this.dictionaries](https://suign.github.io/this.dictionaries/)**

**Each module** in **[all.this](https://neurons.me/all-this)** represents a specific **datastructure**. These classes encapsulate the functionalities and **data specific to their domain.**

## **Utils**
**[all.this](https://neurons.me/all-this)** not only aggregates these modules but also provides utilities to facilitate the integration, management, and enhancement of these data structures. **For example:**

*The integration with [cleaker](https://suign.github.io/cleaker/) ensures each module instance has a **unique cryptographic identity**, enhancing security and data integrity.*
